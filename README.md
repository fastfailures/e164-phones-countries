# e164-phones-countries

A small utility which maps [E.164](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)
international phone numbers to
[ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
[country codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes) as
well as the ISO 3166 country codes to country phone codes.

Inspired by <https://github.com/geneh/e164-phones-countries>.
